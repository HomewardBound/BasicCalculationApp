# BasicCalculationApp

The calculation apps in the Homeward Bound app suite allow for detections of iBeacons to be combined (using techniques such as triangulation) to effectively pinpoint the location of the given iBeacon.

This is app is the most basic calculation app - it simply returns the measurement that it received and does not perform any optimizations of the measurement.

Currently, this app can be run by simply executing 

    python app.py
